                    <p>The mission of the FERIA home, school and community partnership is to provide an inclusive culturally and linguistically responsive conference environment, which creates a learning environment developed by Latino family voices. Professionals and parents will learn about evidence-based programs, home/school language and literacy strategies, agencies and organizations available in the local community. Identify resources that supports the social, emotional and academic development of their children and which will result in fostering student success that prepares individuals with special needs to be contributing members of society and to participate successfully in our local as well as our global community.</p>
